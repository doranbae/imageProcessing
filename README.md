# imageProcessing
This repository will explore various image processing techniques with simple tutorial. Install `opencv` which is most widely used software for image processing. I recommend you to use `virtualenv` to install `opencv` as it is always a good idea to separate projects into different environment as each project may require unqiue configuration. Activate the `virtualenv` and execute this command on your shell. My `virtualenv` has python 3.4 installed. 

```python
source activate YOUR_VIRT_ENV_NAME
conda install -c menpo opencv3
```
